A horse wanders by, conspicuously missing a rider.
The whistle of an arrow marks the death of a rabbit.
A gatherer walks by, collecting berries and herbs.
Flickering light from a torch lights the area momentarily.
The snap of a twig gives away a hunter, his prey springing away. The hunter curses and storms off.
A group of fishermen walk by, tired and hungry.
