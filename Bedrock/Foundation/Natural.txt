The first snowflake of winter lands on a dead leaf.
A forest fire engulfs the land. Afterwards, small seedlings spring from the ashes.
Pouring rain masks the world.
The soft spring shower drizzles budding flowers.
As night falls, the sky turns to soft shades of purple.
White snow covers the branches of evergreens.
Dawn colors the sky in vivid orange and red hues.
Rustling leaves and creaking branches accompany the howling wind.
The land shakes violently in an earthquake.
?<weight >= 45000> You remain in the same spot after the whole ordeal.
?<weight < 45000> You roll around chaotically until the earthquake stops.
