<size >= 1000000> A group of children play on you. One slips and scrapes her knee. She starts crying, and runs home.
Two men meet at night by your side. They argue, and one stabs the other. As the victim bleeds out on the ground, the other man runs away.
In the distance, a rowdy party of drunkards staggers around. One waddles over and pukes on the ground.
The soft hum of a UFO passes overhead.
A couple in love hold hands as they walk by.
