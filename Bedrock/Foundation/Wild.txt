A snake slithers on top of you and basks in the sun.
Underneath you, there are small vibrations from some burrowing mammal in the ground.
In a hurricane, trees fall around and on top of you.
Limping along, a bear collapses. Soon, it becomes food for various scavengers.
The soft thud of a dead bird breaks the relative silence.
A deer runs past, and a pack of wolves pursue it.
A mother mountain lion and her cubs stride past.
